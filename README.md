# Lia Checkout Page

This project implements a checkout page with support for both credit card and Klarna payments. It provides a user-friendly interface for customers to enter shipping and billing information, select a payment method, and complete their purchase.

## Features

- Responsive checkout form with shipping and billing address inputs
- Option to use the same address for shipping and billing
- Payment method selection (Credit/Debit Card or Klarna)
- Dynamic cart summary display
- Integration with Klarna Payments API

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the checkout page structure
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the checkout page
- `checkout.js`: JavaScript file handling form interactions and payment processing

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the checkout page
3. Ensure you have a valid Klarna client token for testing Klarna payments

## Klarna Integration

This project uses Klarna Payments API for processing Klarna payments. To use this feature:

1. Replace `'YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN'` in `checkout.js` with your actual Klarna client token
2. Ensure the Klarna script is properly loaded in `index.html`

## Development Notes

- The project uses vanilla JavaScript without any additional frameworks
- Cart data is currently hardcoded for demonstration purposes. In a real application, this would be dynamically populated
- Additional error handling and form validation should be implemented for production use

## TODO

- Implement server-side processing for payments
- Add form validation for input fields
- Integrate with a backend API for dynamic cart data
- Enhance error handling and user feedback
