# Klarna LIA Checkout Page

This project demonstrates the integration of Klarna's Lightweight Integration Approach (LIA) SDK into a checkout page. It provides a user-friendly interface for customers to enter billing information and complete their purchase using Klarna's payment options.

## Features

- Responsive checkout form with billing address inputs
- Payment method selection (Credit/Debit Card or Klarna)
- Integration with Klarna LIA SDK
- Dynamic cart summary display
- Real-time console output with timestamps for debugging and monitoring

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the checkout page structure
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the checkout page
- `checkout.js`: JavaScript file handling form interactions, Klarna LIA integration, and console logging

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the checkout page
3. Ensure you have a valid Klarna merchant account for testing Klarna payments

## Klarna LIA Integration

This project uses Klarna's LIA SDK for processing Klarna payments. Key integration points:

1. The Klarna LIA SDK script is loaded in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.cs.playground.klarna.com/lia/sdk/lia-sdk_eu.js" async></script>
   ```
2. The `klarnaAsyncCallback` function in `checkout.js` initializes the Klarna LIA SDK
3. The `loadKlarnaWidget` function in `checkout.js` loads the Klarna payment options

## Console Output

The project includes a real-time console output feature for debugging:

- Logs are displayed in a dedicated section on the page
- Each log entry includes a timestamp
- Logs are sorted with the most recent entries at the top

## Development Notes

- The project uses vanilla JavaScript without additional frameworks
- Cart data is currently hardcoded for demonstration purposes
- Additional error handling and form validation should be implemented for production use

## TODO

- Implement server-side processing for order creation and payment authorization
- Add form validation for input fields
- Integrate with a backend API for dynamic cart data
- Enhance error handling and user feedback
- Implement Klarna's post-purchase order management flows
